# Representation Regularization for Domain Generalization: A Second Attempt

This repository contains another attempt to verify the effectiveness of representation regularizations for robustness.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Verify the effectiveness of norm regularization for domain generalization
- **Method**: Apply Nuclear and Frobenius norm regularizations on representations
- **Datasets**: 
  - Colored MNIST
  - Twilight (toy dataset from "[Shortcut Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07780)")
- **Implementation**: Fully custom-coded

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note**: This implementation did not yield the expected improvements in performance.

## Closing Remarks

Months of dedicated coding and rigorous experimentation were invested in this project. The code is elegant, but unfortunately, the underlying concept did not prove effective. Whenever I reflect on this experience, it still breaks my heart.

This project explores shortcut learning. It's important to emphasize that, in life, taking shortcuts that mislead others is highly unethical. Those who engage in such behavior are truly despicable.
